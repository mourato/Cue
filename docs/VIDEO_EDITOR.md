# Video Editor

This doc covers the video editor in `Cue/Features/VideoEditor/`: windowing, trim, cursor controls, zoom segments, Follow Mouse (Smart Camera), speed (timelapse) segments, background/padding, audio mixing, export, GIF resizing, and undo/redo. How recordings and their mouse/audio metadata are produced lives in [`RECORDING.md`](RECORDING.md).

## Cursor

Recordings with Smart Pointer metadata hide the cursor baked by ScreenCaptureKit
and reconstruct it in the editor. The Cursor section owns the reconstructed
cursor's visibility, size, and movement smoothing (`Original`, `Smooth`, or
`Fast`). Click effects and keystroke captions are independent metadata
overlays. Recordings without Smart Pointer metadata keep their native cursor
baked into the video; the editor does not offer a second cursor over that
source. When the recorded pointer leaves the capture area, the reconstructed
cursor fades out until it re-enters.

## Camera overlay (Plan 107)

Recordings with role-tagged screen and camera tracks resolve those tracks by the
metadata track IDs; external multi-track videos are never inferred by array
position. The editor keeps camera video separate from the existing audio mix
and previews it muted, synchronized to the screen playhead. The MVP offers a
visible toggle, four corner presets, three sizes, normalized aspect-fit layout,
and a rounded mask. The optional “Webcam reacts to zoom” toggle is on by
default: it geometrically scales the bubble inversely with screen zoom and
recalculates its corner-anchored placement without following the zoom center.
This is geometric compensation, not face tracking or auto-framing; disabling
it keeps the configured bubble size. Preview and export use the same layout and
export bakes the overlay when it is visible. Hiding it exports screen-only. GIF
output and the default scheme remain screen-only. A missing or invalid camera ID
degrades to screen-only.

```

- `VideoEditorManager` (singleton) tracks windows per Quick Access item id, per URL, and one empty editor; opening an existing item/URL reuses its window.
- Activation policy: switches the app to `.regular` (Dock + ⌘Tab) while an editor is open, reverts to accessory when the last editor/Annotate window closes.
- `VideoEditorWindowController` (`Managers/VideoEditorWindowController.swift`) creates a 1200×800 `VideoEditorWindow` centered on the main screen. Opening from a Quick Access item pauses that item's countdown (`QuickAccessManager.pauseCountdownForEditingItem`) and resumes on close.
- `windowShouldClose` routes through an unsaved-changes alert (Save / Don't Save / Cancel) driven by `state.hasUnsavedChanges`, mirrored to `window.isDocumentEdited`.

## State and Playback

- `VideoEditorState` (`VideoEditorState.swift`) is the central model: asset, trim range, zoom/speed segments, background, export settings, undo stacks. `VideoEditorPlaybackState` holds playhead/playing/scrubbing.
- Playback position comes from an `AVPlayer` periodic time observer at 1/30 s; an item-end observer loops playback within the trim range.
- When a Cue recording has an editor audio source sidecar, the state's asset URL is swapped to the multitrack sidecar (`editorAssetURL(for:metadata:)`) while save/replace keeps targeting the user-facing compatible file.

## Trim

- Visual timeline `Components/VideoEditorVideoTimelineView.swift` with frame-strip thumbnails (`VideoEditorVideoTimelineFrameStrip`) and trim handles (`VideoEditorVideoTrimHandlesView`).
- Frame extraction uses an adaptive `FrameExtractionProfile` — 12 / 16 / 25 frames depending on track/duration, default 25 with zero tolerance.
- **Annotate Current Frame** snapshots the playback time, clamps it to the raw asset duration, and writes one preferred-oriented PNG through the screenshot → Quick Access/History → Annotate path. It does not render editor zoom, background, padding, cursor effects, or speed segments, and never modifies the video source.
- Minimum trim duration 1 s; handle drags clamp the playhead and record undoable `EditorAction.trimStart/trimEnd`.

## Zoom Segments

- `ZoomSegment` (`Models/VideoEditorZoomSegment.swift`): `duration` 0.5–30 s (default 2), `zoomLevel` 1–4x (default 2), `zoomCenter` normalized 0...1, `ZoomType.auto/.manual`, `followSpeed`, `focusMargin`, `isImplicit` for auto-generated segments. `ZoomSegment.centered(at:)` places a new segment centered on the playhead; the **Z** key adds one (`VideoEditorMainView` keyboard shortcut).
- **Automatic zoom (Plan 109):** when a Cue recording opens with click metadata and an empty zoom timeline, `VideoEditorZoomSegmentSynthesizer` builds implicit Follow Mouse segments (Screendrop-aligned timing: 0.3 s pre-roll, 2.5 s post-roll, 1.5× magnification, merge within 2.5 s). Preference `videoEditor.autoGenerateZoomOnOpen` defaults on. **Regenerate Automatic Zooms** in the right sidebar rebuilds implicit segments and preserves manual ones.
- Transitions: ease-in-out cubic (`ZoomCalculator.easeInOutCubic`), `transitionDuration` default 0.4 s clamped to 0.15–0.75 and to 45 % of the segment per edge; the editor-wide `state.zoomTransitionDuration` is user-adjustable in the right sidebar.
- `Services/VideoEditorZoomCalculator.swift` computes per-frame zoom progress/crop rects; shared by preview and the export compositor.
- UI: zoom timeline track (`VideoEditorZoomTimelineTrack` + `VideoEditorZoomBlockView`), center picker (`VideoEditorZoomCenterPicker`, with presets top-left/top-right/bottom-left/bottom-right/center), live preview overlay (`VideoEditorZoomPreviewOverlay`), settings popover (`VideoEditorZoomSettingsPopover`).

## Follow Mouse (Smart Camera)

- `Services/VideoEditorAutoFocusEngine.swift` `buildPath` consumes `RecordingMetadata` (see [`RECORDING.md`](RECORDING.md)) and reconstructs a smooth camera path: dead-zone around the current center with adaptive shrink under motion, exponential smoothing, cursor-speed clamp, last-visible-position fallback when the cursor leaves the capture, resample to ≤60 Hz, all clamped to the frame.
- `AutoFocusSettings` (`Models/VideoEditorAutoFocusSettings.swift`): `followSpeed` range 0.2–1.0 (default 0.55), `focusMargin` range 0.2–0.9 (default 0.45), `defaultZoomLevel` 2.0.
- New zoom segments default to `.auto` when mouse metadata exists; otherwise manual.

## Speed (Timelapse) Segments

- `SpeedSegment` (`Models/VideoEditorSpeedSegment.swift`): `rate` 0.25–8x (presets 0.25/0.5/1/2/4/8), min duration 0.5 s; segments cannot overlap (state-level validation).
- `Services/VideoEditorSpeedTimeMap.swift` is the single original↔scaled time-mapping authority reused by export, preview, playhead, and thumbnails.
- Export applies `scaleTimeRange` to composition video + audio tracks in reverse segment order, remaps zoom times and auto-focus keyframes into the scaled timeline, and preserves audio pitch via `audioTimePitchAlgorithm = .spectral`.
- Live preview is approximate: it drives `AVPlayer.rate` per active segment instead of rebuilding a scaled composition.
- Video only — the GIF save path does not bake timeline edits, so the speed track is hidden for GIF sources.

## Background and Padding

- `BackgroundStyle` (shared `Cue/Features/Annotate/Models/AnnotateBackgroundStyle.swift`): `none`, `gradient`, `wallpaper(URL)`, `blurred(URL)`, `solidColor`. Combined with padding, shadow, corner radius, alignment, and aspect controls in the left sidebar (`VideoEditorVideoBackgroundSidebarView`); background changes are undoable.

## Audio in the Editor

- Multitrack recordings load the sidecar asset (see State above). Track roles come from stored metadata keyed by `AVAssetTrack.trackID`, falling back to `ScreenRecordingManager` writer order for older metadata.
- `VideoEditorAudioTrackRole` (`Models/VideoEditorExportSettings.swift`): `mixed`, `systemAudio`, `microphone`, `additional(Int)`. Per-role volume sliders in the export settings panel; `VideoEditorAudioMixFactory.makeAudioMix` builds the role-aware `AVAudioMix` shared by preview and export, so volume changes are audible before saving.
- Recordings made before the sidecar existed contain one mixed track and expose a single volume control; separated sources cannot be recovered from them.
- Exports are re-normalized to one stereo AAC track after multitrack export (`RecordingAudioCompatibilityExporter`), so saved files stay broadly compatible.

## Export

`Services/VideoEditorExporter.swift` routes `exportTrimmed(state:to:progress:)`:

| Condition | Path |
| --- | --- |
| Zooms, background, or speed segments present | `exportWithZooms` — `AVMutableComposition` + custom `ZoomCompositor` (`AVVideoCompositing`, CI/Metal per-frame render) |
| `exportSettings.audioMode == .mute` (no effects) | `exportVideoOnly` |
| Otherwise | `exportStandard` |

- Custom dimensions: `ExportDimensionPreset` + `VideoEditorExportLayout` (`Models/VideoEditorExportSettings.swift`), even-aligned pixel sizes; quality presets live in the same export settings model.
- Save flow (`VideoEditorWindowController.showSaveConfirmation`): temp captures save directly to a chosen destination; saved files prompt Replace Original vs Save As Copy.
  - Replace original: export to temp, move original to `.<name>.backup`, atomic `replaceItemAt` swap, restore from backup on failure; recording metadata for the replaced file is deleted. Permission-denied falls back to a Save As Copy prompt.
  - Save as copy: `_trimmed` suffix suggestion (`generateCopyFilename`, counter on collision) + `NSSavePanel`.
- After a successful export, the Video module closes or returns to its local result. Image-host upload is not offered for video or GIF output; BYO cloud upload offers were removed and the Video module itself remains available.

### Plan 108 characterization (2026-08-23)

A temporary XCTest used a synthetic 4-second, 320×180 source with trim, zoom,
speed, solid background, custom dimensions, and custom-audio settings. Two
Save As exports produced identical 354,495-byte outputs in 348 ms and 187 ms;
Replace Original took 192 ms and produced the same size. The fixture had no
audio track, so this measures the composition path and settings route rather
than a real multitrack audio normalization cost.

The measured repeated-export cost does not justify durable cache infrastructure
yet. Plan 108 therefore stops at characterization (YAGNI): no recipe, cache
manifest, App Support directory, or exporter integration is added. If real
long-duration or multitrack exports show material repeated cost, a follow-up
plan should preserve these decisions: source is read-only, cache output is a
discardable deliverable, and reopening a baked output never reapplies a recipe.

## GIF Editing

- GIF mode is dimension-change only — no trim, zoom, or speed; saving with unchanged dimensions shows a "no changes" alert.
- `Services/GIFResizer.swift`: ImageIO per-frame resize that preserves loop count and frame delays; `GIFMetadata` reads source properties; `VideoEditorAnimatedGIFView` renders the animated preview.
- Replace-original and save-as-copy (`_resized.gif`) flows mirror video.

## Undo / Redo

- In-memory `undoStack`/`redoStack` of `EditorAction` (max 50) inside `VideoEditorState`; covers trim, zoom add/remove/update, speed add/remove/update/toggle, mute, and background changes. Shortcuts: ⌘Z / ⇧⌘Z (toolbar buttons in `VideoEditorToolbarView`).
- Any recorded action sets `hasUnsavedChanges` → `isDocumentEdited` + close alert.

## Bottom Bar (HEAD)

`Components/VideoEditorBottomBar.swift`: **Cancel** | **Convert/Save** (⌘S; title is "Save" for temp captures, "Convert" otherwise) with an export progress strip (`VideoEditorExportProgressOverlay` during export).
